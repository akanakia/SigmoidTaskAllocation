\section{Introduction}
There has been considerable research done using swarm robot systems to tackle tasks  such as firefighting. Time often plays an important role in such situations, e.g. fires tend to spread at an exponential rate if not contained quickly. Thus, the overall utility of the system also varies with time. We describe a process that maximizes time-varying utility of a swarm robot system for accomplishing time-varying tasks, through the use of sigmoid threshold functions for collaboration decisions.

The goal of this model is to represent tasks that have the property of ``concurrent benefit''. We define concurrent benefit as an attribute of a collaborative task wherein the exact number of robots required to successfully complete the task is unknown and varies with time but the probability of success depends, non-linearly, on the average number of agents assigned to that task. For example, in a firefighting scenario a single robot trying to contain a large fire will almost definitely be unsuccessful on its own (and will waste water in trying) but a group of robots within a certain group size range may be able to contain the flames to a reasonable level of success. This measure of success is related non-linearly to the group size, i.e. where 5 or even 10 robots have a negligible effect on containing the fire, perhaps 12 or more very quickly become capable of succeeding in the task. The group size to payoff ratio is described by a utility function that is itself sigmoid in nature, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:sigmoid}.

\end{figure*}

It is for such tasks that we create this swarm system model and describe optimization methods for global, system level utility. The scenario is set up as follows. We assume a large operational area, compared to the size of a collaboration site. Collaboration sites are distributed randomly (but not necessarily uniformly) around the operational area. We assume a large swarm of robots is also dispersed in the operational area. The total number of robots is arbitrary but we assume it is unchanging throughout the course of the scenario. This is done mostly for mathematical simplicity of the system model and we later discuss how to relax this condition for size varying swarms. Each collaboration site comprises of some arbitrary task that a group of robots must perform to increase the overall system utility of the swarm. These tasks can include the aforementioned fire containment or lifting an object for collective transport, etc. Henceforth, we will use the terms collaboration site and task interchangeably.

\section{System Model}
Important Points:

- We define a class of tasks where there is a trade-off between time (waiting for more agents) vs probability of success (starting to work immediately).

- The Utility of the system is sigmoid in nature.

- Our approach accounts for errors in the model coming from robot sensors, inaccurate measurements, etc. (using theta in the sigmoid function)
