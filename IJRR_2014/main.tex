\section{Introduction}
There has been considerable research done using swarm robot systems to tackle tasks with unknown utility such as firefighting. Time often plays an important role in such situations, e.g. fires tend to spread at an exponential rate if not contained quickly. Thus, the overall utility of the system also varies with time. We describe a process that maximizes time-varying utility of a swarm robot system for accomplishing time-varying tasks, through the use of sigmoid threshold functions for collaboration decisions.
