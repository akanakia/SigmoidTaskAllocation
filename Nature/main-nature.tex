\begin{abstract}
Response-threshold models have been used to model task-allocation in insect colonies since the 1980s. More recently, these models have been picked-up by swarm roboticists to solve the problem of task-assignment in multi-agent systems (MAS). So far, the justification for the  widespread use of response-threshold models in both communities has been phenomenological in nature, i.e. the relative accuracy with which they predict observed insect colony behavior. We present a new game theory based approach to provide a rational argument for their success by showing that independent threshold based task-allocation by agents results in a system-wide Bayes Nash Equilibrium.

Collaboration is a fundamental necessity in any society. Tasks such as foraging, farming, hunting, and construction that were essential building blocks of human civilization greatly benefited from collaboration between multiple individuals. Social insects have evolved to facilitate collaboration in a decentralized manner. The problem of allocating tasks to a group of agents is solved in a completely distributed fashion within insect swarms such as ant colonies and bee hives. While a central queen organism often exists in insect colonies, this organism's duty is purely reproductive in nature, not administrative.
%%% WHAT IS THE KEY PROBLEM WITH COLLABORATION? AGREEING ON WHEN TO DO IT REQUIRES A COMMON STIMULULUS AND COORDINATION

Ethologists have studied the problem of distribution of labor in social insects extensively and have found that a class of models called response-threshold models explain observed behavior very well. Swarm roboticists have adopted this model of distributed task-assignment and adapted it for use with artificially engineered systems. While extensive phenomenological evidence exists supporting the agreement between response-threshold models and successful task-assignment, there has so far been no logical argument for their extensive use. 
%%% THE PROBLEM HAS NOT ONLY BEEN STUDIED BY ETHOLOGISTS FOR ANTS BUT ALSO BY NEUROLOGISTS AND ECONOMISTS (GAME THEORY). WHO ELSE STUDIES TASK ALLOCATION IF IT IS REALLY SO IMPORTANT?

%%% DONT FRAME THE PAPER AROUND THE SOLUTION "RESPONSE THRESHOLD", BUT AROUND THE COMMON SETUP: A NUMBER OF AGENTS MUST AGREE UPON SOMETHING BUT CANNOT TALK TO EACH OTHER, JUST OBSERVE A COMMON SIGNAL WITH MAYBE NOISE. 

%%% WHAT ARE THE COMMONALITIES AMONG ALL THE CONSENSUS PROBLEMS / WHAT CLASS OF PROBLEMS ARE WE INTERESTED IN. THIS SHOULD MATCH THE GAME THEORY DEFINITION. THERE ARE MANY. WHERE HAS THE RESPONSE THRESHOLD ALREADY BEEN OBSERVED AND WHERE IS IT USED? ETHOLOGY AND ROBOTICS. THEY ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT GAME THEORY ASSUMES, HERE IS WHY: NOISE. 

% MAIN CLAIM: THERE ARE COUNTLESS SYSTMES THAT MUST RESPONSE THRESHOLDS, BECAUSE THERE ARE THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IN THIS CASE.
