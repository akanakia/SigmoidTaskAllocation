\begin{abstract}
For Nature, the abstract is really an introductory paragraph set in bold type.  This paragraph must be ``fully referenced'' and less than 180 words for Letters.  This is the thing that is supposed to be aimed at people from other disciplines and is arguably the most important part to getting your paper past the editors.  End this paragraph with a sentence like ``Here we show...'' or something similar.

Collaboration is a fundamental necessity in any society. Tasks such as foraging, farming, hunting, and construction that were essential building blocks of human civilization greatly benefited from collaboration between multiple individuals. Social insects have evolved to facilitate collaboration in a decentralized manner. The problem of allocating tasks to a group of agents is solved in a completely distributed fashion within insect swarms such as ant colonies and bee hives. While a central queen organism often exists in insect colonies, this organism's duty is purely reproductive in nature, not administrative. 

Ethologists have studied the problem of distribution of labor in social insects extensively and have found that a class of models called response-threshold models explain observed behavior very well. Swarm roboticists have adopted this model of distributed task-assignment and adapted it for use with artificially engineered systems. While extensive phenomenological evidence exists supporting the agreement between response-threshold models and successful task-assignment, there has so far been no logical argument for their extensive use.
